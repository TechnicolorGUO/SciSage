        "section_key_point": "Definition and overview of AI agent frameworks",
        "section_text": "AI agent frameworks have evolved significantly over the years, with various architectures and capabilities being developed to tackle complex tasks [4]. The primary objectives of these frameworks are to enable AI agents to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. One of the key aspects of AI agent frameworks is their ability to integrate large language models (LLMs) with dedicated modules for perception, planning, and tool use [4]. For instance, the MLGym framework and benchmark [3] evaluate and develop LLM agents on AI research tasks, such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, and analyzing results. The framework consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory [3].\n\nThe MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks [3]. We find that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements [3].\n\nThis survey paper examines the recent advancements in AI agent implementations, with a focus on their ability to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. The primary objectives of this work are to a) communicate the current capabilities and limitations of existing AI agent implementations, b) share insights gained from our observations of these systems in action, and c) suggest important considerations for future developments in AI agent design [4]. We achieve this by providing overviews of single-agent and multi-agent architectures, identifying key patterns and divergences in design choices, and evaluating their overall impact on accomplishing a provided goal [4].\n\nThis paper examines the evolution, architecture, and practical applications of AI agents from their early, rule-based incarnations to modern sophisticated systems that integrate large language models with dedicated modules for perception, planning, and tool use [6]. Emphasizing both theoretical foundations and real-world deployments, the paper reviews key agent paradigms, discusses limitations of current evaluation benchmarks, and proposes a holistic evaluation framework that balances task effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and safety [6]. Applications across enterprise, personal assistance, and specialized domains are analyzed, with insights into future research directions for more resilient and adaptive AI agent systems [6].\n\nLifelong learning, also known as continual or incremental learning, is a crucial component for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by enabling systems to continuously adapt in dynamic environments [5]. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing, existing LLM agents are typically designed for static systems and lack the ability to adapt over time in response to new challenges [5]. This survey is the first to systematically summarize the potential techniques for incorporating lifelong learning into LLM-based agents [5]. We categorize the core components of these agents into three modules: the perception module for multimodal input integration, the memory module for storing and retrieving evolving knowledge, and the action module for grounded interactions with the dynamic environment [5]. We highlight how these pillars collectively enable continuous adaptation, mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and improve long-term performance [5].\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have undergone significant expansion and have been increasingly integrated across various domains [7]. Notably, in the realm of robot task planning, LLMs harness their advanced reasoning and language comprehension capabilities to formulate precise and efficient action plans based on natural language instructions [7]. However, for embodied tasks, where robots interact with complex environments, text-only LLMs often face challenges due to a lack of compatibility with robotic visual perception [7]. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging integration of LLMs and multimodal LLMs into various robotic tasks [7]. Additionally, we propose a framework that utilizes multimodal GPT-4V to enhance embodied task planning through the combination of natural language instructions and robot visual perceptions [7]. Our results, based on diverse datasets, indicate that GPT-4V effectively enhances robot performance in embodied tasks [7]. This extensive survey and evaluation of LLMs and multimodal LLMs across a variety of robotic tasks enriches the understanding of LLM-centric embodied intelligence and provides forward-looking insights toward bridging the gap in Human-Robot-Environment interaction [7].\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities across domains, tasks, and languages [8]. Such human-level agents require semantic comprehension and instruction-following capabilities, which exactly fall into the strengths of LLMs [8]. Although there have been several initial attempts to build human-level agents based on LLMs, the theoretical foundation remains a challenging open problem [8]. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical cognitive architecture, the Unified Mind Model (UMM), which offers guidance to facilitate the rapid creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities [8]. Specifically, our UMM starts with the global workspace theory and further leverage LLMs to enable the agent with various cognitive abilities, such as multi-modal perception, planning, reasoning, tool use, learning, memory, reflection and motivation [8]. Building upon UMM, we then develop an agent-building engine, MindOS, which allows users to quickly create domain-/task-specific autonomous agents without any programming effort [8].\n\nIntellAgent is a scalable, open-source multi-agent framework designed to evaluate conversational AI systems comprehensively [9]. IntellAgent automates the creation of diverse, synthetic benchmarks by combining policy-driven graph modeling, realistic event generation, and interactive user-agent simulations [9]. This innovative approach provides fine-grained diagnostics, addressing the limitations of static and manually curated benchmarks with coarse-grained metrics [9]. IntellAgent represents a paradigm shift in evaluating conversational AI [9]. By simulating realistic, multi-policy scenarios across varying levels of complexity, IntellAgent captures the nuanced interplay of agent capabilities and policy constraints [9]. Unlike traditional methods, it employs a graph-based policy model to represent relationships, likelihoods, and complexities of policy interactions, enabling highly detailed diagnostics [9]. IntellAgent also identifies critical performance gaps, offering actionable insights for targeted optimization [9]. Its modular, open-source design supports seamless integration of new domains, policies, and APIs, fostering reproducibility and community collaboration [9]. Our findings demonstrate that IntellAgent serves as an effective framework for advancing conversational AI by addressing challenges in bridging research and deployment [9].\n\nAI Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs) as its cognitive core, is an intelligent agentic system capable of autonomously controlling and determining the execution paths under user's instructions [10]. With the burst of capabilities of LLMs and various plugins, such as RAG, text-to-image/video/3D, etc., the potential of AI Agents has been vastly expanded, with their capabilities growing stronger by the day [10]. However, at the intersection between AI and web3, there is currently no ideal agentic framework that can seamlessly integrate web3 applications into AI agent functionalities [10]. In this paper, we propose Eliza, the first open-source web3-friendly Agentic framework that makes the deployment of web3 applications effortless [10]. We emphasize that every aspect of Eliza is a regular Typescript program under the full control of its user, and it seamlessly integrates with web3 (i.e., reading and writing blockchain data, interacting with smart contracts, etc.) [10]. Furthermore, we show how stable performance is achieved through the pragmatic implementation of the key components of Eliza's runtime [10]. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ai16z/eliza [10].\n\nAI agents are defined as artificial entities to perceive the environment, make decisions and take actions [11]. Inspired by the 6 levels of autonomous driving by Society of Automotive Engineers, the AI agents are also categorized based on utilities and strongness, as the following levels: L0, no AI, with tools taking into account perception plus actions; L1, using rule-based AI; L2, making rule-based AI replaced by IL/RL-based AI, with additional reasoning & decision making; L3, applying LLM-based AI instead of IL/RL-based AI, additionally setting up memory & reflection; L4, based on L3, facilitating autonomous learning & generalization; L5, based on L4, appending personality of emotion and character and collaborative behavior with multi-agents [11].\n\n\n\nAnother significant aspect of AI agent frameworks is their ability to learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments . This requires new interaction protocols, delegation strategies, and responsibility distribution frameworks. For example, the AI Agents: Evolution, Architecture, and Real-World Applications paper  examines the evolution, architecture, and practical applications of AI agents, emphasizing both theoretical foundations and real-world deployments.\n\nFurthermore, AI agent frameworks can be categorized based on their utilities and strength, as follows: L0, no AI, with tools taking into account perception plus actions [0]; L1, using rule-based AI [0]; L2, making rule-based AI replaced by IL/RL-based AI, with additional reasoning & decision making [0]; L3, applying LLM-based AI instead of IL/RL-based AI, additionally setting up memory & reflection [0]; L4, based on L3, facilitating autonomous learning & generalization [0]; L5, based on L4, appending personality of emotion and character and collaborative behavior with multi-agents [0]. \n\nRecent advancements in AI agent implementations have focused on their ability to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. This includes the development of frameworks such as AutoAgent [1], a fully-automated and zero-code framework for LLM agents, and IntellAgent [9], a multi-agent framework for evaluating conversational AI systems. Additionally, Eliza [10] is a web3-friendly agentic framework that seamlessly integrates web3 applications into AI agent functionalities.\n\nIn summary, AI agent frameworks have evolved to integrate LLMs, learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments. They can be categorized based on their utilities and strength, and are being developed to tackle complex tasks such as AI research, human-AI teaming, and decision-making . Recent advancements in AI agent implementations have focused on their ability to achieve complex goals, and new frameworks have been developed to support these capabilities.\n\nRecent studies have also explored the integration of LLMs with multimodal perception, planning, and tool use, enabling AI agents to tackle complex tasks in various domains [7]. For example, the CATP-LLM framework [0] empowers LLMs for cost-aware tool planning, while the Unified Mind Model (UMM) [8] provides a novel theoretical cognitive architecture for creating autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities. These frameworks and architectures demonstrate the potential of LLMs in multimodal tasks and highlight the need for further research in this area.\n\nMoreover, researchers have proposed frameworks for lifelong learning of LLM-based agents, enabling them to continuously adapt in dynamic environments [5]. These frameworks incorporate techniques such as multimodal perception, planning, and tool use, as well as memory and reflection modules, to enable continuous adaptation and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. For example, CATP-LLM [0] empowers LLMs for cost-aware tool planning, while AutoAgent [1] enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Additionally, frameworks such as Meta MLGym [3] and MLGym-Bench [3] provide a new framework and benchmark for evaluating and developing LLM agents on AI research tasks. Furthermore, the Unified Mind Model [8] offers guidance to facilitate the rapid creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities. \n\nIn conclusion, AI agent frameworks have evolved to integrate LLMs, learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments. They can be categorized based on their utilities and strength, and are being developed to tackle complex tasks such as AI research, human-AI teaming, and decision-making . Recent advancements in AI agent implementations have focused on their ability to achieve complex goals, and new frameworks have been developed to support these capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, AI agent frameworks have been applied in various real-world applications, including enterprise, personal assistance, and specialized domains [4]. For instance, AI agents have been used in customer service, healthcare, and finance to provide personalized assistance and decision-making support [1]. Additionally, AI agents have been used in robotics to enhance task planning and execution [7]. Moreover, AI agents have been used in web3 applications to provide seamless integration with AI functionalities [10].

        "section_text": "An AI agent framework is a software architecture that enables the development and deployment of autonomous agents that can interact with their environment and make decisions based on their perception and goals [2]. These frameworks typically provide a set of tools and components that allow developers to build, train, and manage AI agents, including natural language processing, machine learning, and decision-making capabilities [0][1][3][4][5][6].\n\nLangGraph is a modular framework for enhancing machine translation using large language models (LLMs) [6]. It is designed to simplify the creation and management of agents and their workflows, enabling efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention [4]. LangGraph integrates with LLMs, such as GPT-4o, to ensure accurate, contextually relevant translations while maintaining modularity, scalability, and context retention [6]. It also supports dynamic state management, enabling agents to maintain dialogue context and automates complex workflows by linking agents and facilitating their collaboration [6]. LangGraph is a graph-based framework built on LangChain, which simplifies the creation and management of these agents and their workflows [6]. \n\nLangGraph can be seen as an AI agent framework because it provides a set of tools and components that allow developers to build, train, and manage AI agents, including natural language processing, machine learning, and decision-making capabilities . It enables the creation of modular agents that can interact with their environment and make decisions based on their perception and goals, and it supports dynamic state management and workflow orchestration . LangGraph's ability to integrate with LLMs and other components, such as Spark, makes it a versatile and powerful tool for building AI agents .\n\nLangGraph's graph-based architecture enables modular and scalable AI agents. The framework's use of graph-structured workflows allows for the efficient creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention . This modularity and scalability make LangGraph a valuable tool for building AI agents that can interact with their environment and make decisions based on their perception and goals .\n\nLangGraph has been applied in various areas, including dialogue systems and decision-making tasks [0][1][2][3][4][5][6]. For example, it has been used in multi-agent collaborative intelligence for adaptive reasoning and temporal planning [0], and it has been integrated with authenticated delegation and authorized AI agents for secure task delegation [1]. Additionally, LangGraph has been used in agentic retrieval-augmented generation for complex task management and multistep reasoning [2]. Its applications in these areas demonstrate its potential for building AI agents that can interact with their environment and make decisions based on their perception and goals [2]. LangGraph has also been applied in machine translation, where it has been used to enhance the automation and effectiveness of translation tasks [6]. In this context, LangGraph has been used to create modular agents that can perform specific translation tasks, such as translating between particular languages [6]. These agents leverage the powerful semantic capabilities of large language models to ensure accurate and contextually relevant translations [6]. Overall, LangGraph has been shown to be a versatile and effective tool for building AI agents that can interact with their environment and perform a wide range of tasks [2][3][4][5][6]. \n\nLangGraph's integration with Spark and other components, such as Kafka, enables high-performance execution and efficient handling of large-scale data streams [3]. The framework's ability to support real-time state streaming, debugging via LangGraph Studio, and efficient handling of large-scale data streams make it ideal for adaptive decision-making [3]. Experimental results confirm the system's ability to classify inquiries, detect sentiment trends, and escalate complex issues for manual review, demonstrating a synergistic blend of LLM capabilities and human oversight [3].\n\nLangGraph's graph-based architecture also enables the creation of scalable and user-friendly AI solutions. The framework's use of graph-structured workflows allows for the efficient creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention . This modularity and scalability make LangGraph a valuable tool for building AI agents that can interact with their environment and make decisions based on their perception and goals .\n\nIn summary, LangGraph is a modular framework for enhancing machine translation using large language models (LLMs) [6]. It provides a set of tools and components that allow developers to build, train, and manage AI agents, including natural language processing, machine learning, and decision-making capabilities [6]. LangGraph's graph-based architecture enables modular and scalable AI agents, and its integration with Spark and other components enables high-performance execution and efficient handling of large-scale data streams [6]. Its applications in various areas demonstrate its potential for building AI agents that can interact with their environment and make decisions based on their perception and goals [6]. ",

                    "section_text": "AI agent frameworks have evolved significantly over the years, with various architectures and capabilities being developed to tackle complex tasks [4]. The primary objectives of these frameworks are to enable AI agents to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. One of the key aspects of AI agent frameworks is their ability to integrate large language models (LLMs) with dedicated modules for perception, planning, and tool use [4]. For instance, the MLGym framework and benchmark [3] evaluate and develop LLM agents on AI research tasks, such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, and analyzing results. The framework consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory [3].\n\nThe MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks [3]. We find that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements [3].\n\nThis survey paper examines the recent advancements in AI agent implementations, with a focus on their ability to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. The primary objectives of this work are to a) communicate the current capabilities and limitations of existing AI agent implementations, b) share insights gained from our observations of these systems in action, and c) suggest important considerations for future developments in AI agent design [4]. We achieve this by providing overviews of single-agent and multi-agent architectures, identifying key patterns and divergences in design choices, and evaluating their overall impact on accomplishing a provided goal [4].\n\nThis paper examines the evolution, architecture, and practical applications of AI agents from their early, rule-based incarnations to modern sophisticated systems that integrate large language models with dedicated modules for perception, planning, and tool use [6]. Emphasizing both theoretical foundations and real-world deployments, the paper reviews key agent paradigms, discusses limitations of current evaluation benchmarks, and proposes a holistic evaluation framework that balances task effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and safety [6]. Applications across enterprise, personal assistance, and specialized domains are analyzed, with insights into future research directions for more resilient and adaptive AI agent systems [6].\n\nLifelong learning, also known as continual or incremental learning, is a crucial component for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by enabling systems to continuously adapt in dynamic environments [5]. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing, existing LLM agents are typically designed for static systems and lack the ability to adapt over time in response to new challenges [5]. This survey is the first to systematically summarize the potential techniques for incorporating lifelong learning into LLM-based agents [5]. We categorize the core components of these agents into three modules: the perception module for multimodal input integration, the memory module for storing and retrieving evolving knowledge, and the action module for grounded interactions with the dynamic environment [5]. We highlight how these pillars collectively enable continuous adaptation, mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and improve long-term performance [5].\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have undergone significant expansion and have been increasingly integrated across various domains [7]. Notably, in the realm of robot task planning, LLMs harness their advanced reasoning and language comprehension capabilities to formulate precise and efficient action plans based on natural language instructions [7]. However, for embodied tasks, where robots interact with complex environments, text-only LLMs often face challenges due to a lack of compatibility with robotic visual perception [7]. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging integration of LLMs and multimodal LLMs into various robotic tasks [7]. Additionally, we propose a framework that utilizes multimodal GPT-4V to enhance embodied task planning through the combination of natural language instructions and robot visual perceptions [7]. Our results, based on diverse datasets, indicate that GPT-4V effectively enhances robot performance in embodied tasks [7]. This extensive survey and evaluation of LLMs and multimodal LLMs across a variety of robotic tasks enriches the understanding of LLM-centric embodied intelligence and provides forward-looking insights toward bridging the gap in Human-Robot-Environment interaction [7].\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities across domains, tasks, and languages [8]. Such human-level agents require semantic comprehension and instruction-following capabilities, which exactly fall into the strengths of LLMs [8]. Although there have been several initial attempts to build human-level agents based on LLMs, the theoretical foundation remains a challenging open problem [8]. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical cognitive architecture, the Unified Mind Model (UMM), which offers guidance to facilitate the rapid creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities [8]. Specifically, our UMM starts with the global workspace theory and further leverage LLMs to enable the agent with various cognitive abilities, such as multi-modal perception, planning, reasoning, tool use, learning, memory, reflection and motivation [8]. Building upon UMM, we then develop an agent-building engine, MindOS, which allows users to quickly create domain-/task-specific autonomous agents without any programming effort [8].\n\nIntellAgent is a scalable, open-source multi-agent framework designed to evaluate conversational AI systems comprehensively [9]. IntellAgent automates the creation of diverse, synthetic benchmarks by combining policy-driven graph modeling, realistic event generation, and interactive user-agent simulations [9]. This innovative approach provides fine-grained diagnostics, addressing the limitations of static and manually curated benchmarks with coarse-grained metrics [9]. IntellAgent represents a paradigm shift in evaluating conversational AI [9]. By simulating realistic, multi-policy scenarios across varying levels of complexity, IntellAgent captures the nuanced interplay of agent capabilities and policy constraints [9]. Unlike traditional methods, it employs a graph-based policy model to represent relationships, likelihoods, and complexities of policy interactions, enabling highly detailed diagnostics [9]. IntellAgent also identifies critical performance gaps, offering actionable insights for targeted optimization [9]. Its modular, open-source design supports seamless integration of new domains, policies, and APIs, fostering reproducibility and community collaboration [9]. Our findings demonstrate that IntellAgent serves as an effective framework for advancing conversational AI by addressing challenges in bridging research and deployment [9].\n\nAI Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs) as its cognitive core, is an intelligent agentic system capable of autonomously controlling and determining the execution paths under user's instructions [10]. With the burst of capabilities of LLMs and various plugins, such as RAG, text-to-image/video/3D, etc., the potential of AI Agents has been vastly expanded, with their capabilities growing stronger by the day [10]. However, at the intersection between AI and web3, there is currently no ideal agentic framework that can seamlessly integrate web3 applications into AI agent functionalities [10]. In this paper, we propose Eliza, the first open-source web3-friendly Agentic framework that makes the deployment of web3 applications effortless [10]. We emphasize that every aspect of Eliza is a regular Typescript program under the full control of its user, and it seamlessly integrates with web3 (i.e., reading and writing blockchain data, interacting with smart contracts, etc.) [10]. Furthermore, we show how stable performance is achieved through the pragmatic implementation of the key components of Eliza's runtime [10]. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ai16z/eliza [10].\n\nAI agents are defined as artificial entities to perceive the environment, make decisions and take actions [11]. Inspired by the 6 levels of autonomous driving by Society of Automotive Engineers, the AI agents are also categorized based on utilities and strongness, as the following levels: L0, no AI, with tools taking into account perception plus actions; L1, using rule-based AI; L2, making rule-based AI replaced by IL/RL-based AI, with additional reasoning & decision making; L3, applying LLM-based AI instead of IL/RL-based AI, additionally setting up memory & reflection; L4, based on L3, facilitating autonomous learning & generalization; L5, based on L4, appending personality of emotion and character and collaborative behavior with multi-agents [11].\n\n\n\nAnother significant aspect of AI agent frameworks is their ability to learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments . This requires new interaction protocols, delegation strategies, and responsibility distribution frameworks. For example, the AI Agents: Evolution, Architecture, and Real-World Applications paper  examines the evolution, architecture, and practical applications of AI agents, emphasizing both theoretical foundations and real-world deployments.\n\nFurthermore, AI agent frameworks can be categorized based on their utilities and strength, as follows: L0, no AI, with tools taking into account perception plus actions [0]; L1, using rule-based AI [0]; L2, making rule-based AI replaced by IL/RL-based AI, with additional reasoning & decision making [0]; L3, applying LLM-based AI instead of IL/RL-based AI, additionally setting up memory & reflection [0]; L4, based on L3, facilitating autonomous learning & generalization [0]; L5, based on L4, appending personality of emotion and character and collaborative behavior with multi-agents [0]. \n\nRecent advancements in AI agent implementations have focused on their ability to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. This includes the development of frameworks such as AutoAgent [1], a fully-automated and zero-code framework for LLM agents, and IntellAgent [9], a multi-agent framework for evaluating conversational AI systems. Additionally, Eliza [10] is a web3-friendly agentic framework that seamlessly integrates web3 applications into AI agent functionalities.\n\nIn summary, AI agent frameworks have evolved to integrate LLMs, learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments. They can be categorized based on their utilities and strength, and are being developed to tackle complex tasks such as AI research, human-AI teaming, and decision-making . Recent advancements in AI agent implementations have focused on their ability to achieve complex goals, and new frameworks have been developed to support these capabilities.\n\nRecent studies have also explored the integration of LLMs with multimodal perception, planning, and tool use, enabling AI agents to tackle complex tasks in various domains [7]. For example, the CATP-LLM framework [0] empowers LLMs for cost-aware tool planning, while the Unified Mind Model (UMM) [8] provides a novel theoretical cognitive architecture for creating autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities. These frameworks and architectures demonstrate the potential of LLMs in multimodal tasks and highlight the need for further research in this area.\n\nMoreover, researchers have proposed frameworks for lifelong learning of LLM-based agents, enabling them to continuously adapt in dynamic environments [5]. These frameworks incorporate techniques such as multimodal perception, planning, and tool use, as well as memory and reflection modules, to enable continuous adaptation and mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

            "section_text": "AI agent frameworks have evolved significantly over the years, with various architectures and capabilities being developed to tackle complex tasks [4]. The primary objectives of these frameworks are to enable AI agents to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. One of the key aspects of AI agent frameworks is their ability to integrate large language models (LLMs) with dedicated modules for perception, planning, and tool use [4]. For instance, the MLGym framework and benchmark [3] evaluate and develop LLM agents on AI research tasks, such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, and analyzing results. The framework consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory [3].\n\nThe MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks [3]. We find that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements [3].\n\nThis survey paper examines the recent advancements in AI agent implementations, with a focus on their ability to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. The primary objectives of this work are to a) communicate the current capabilities and limitations of existing AI agent implementations, b) share insights gained from our observations of these systems in action, and c) suggest important considerations for future developments in AI agent design [4]. We achieve this by providing overviews of single-agent and multi-agent architectures, identifying key patterns and divergences in design choices, and evaluating their overall impact on accomplishing a provided goal [4].\n\nThis paper examines the evolution, architecture, and practical applications of AI agents from their early, rule-based incarnations to modern sophisticated systems that integrate large language models with dedicated modules for perception, planning, and tool use [6]. Emphasizing both theoretical foundations and real-world deployments, the paper reviews key agent paradigms, discusses limitations of current evaluation benchmarks, and proposes a holistic evaluation framework that balances task effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and safety [6]. Applications across enterprise, personal assistance, and specialized domains are analyzed, with insights into future research directions for more resilient and adaptive AI agent systems [6].\n\nLifelong learning, also known as continual or incremental learning, is a crucial component for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by enabling systems to continuously adapt in dynamic environments [5]. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing, existing LLM agents are typically designed for static systems and lack the ability to adapt over time in response to new challenges [5]. This survey is the first to systematically summarize the potential techniques for incorporating lifelong learning into LLM-based agents [5]. We categorize the core components of these agents into three modules: the perception module for multimodal input integration, the memory module for storing and retrieving evolving knowledge, and the action module for grounded interactions with the dynamic environment [5]. We highlight how these pillars collectively enable continuous adaptation, mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and improve long-term performance [5].\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have undergone significant expansion and have been increasingly integrated across various domains [7]. Notably, in the realm of robot task planning, LLMs harness their advanced reasoning and language comprehension capabilities to formulate precise and efficient action plans based on natural language instructions [7]. However, for embodied tasks, where robots interact with complex environments, text-only LLMs often face challenges due to a lack of compatibility with robotic visual perception [7]. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging integration of LLMs and multimodal LLMs into various robotic tasks [7]. Additionally, we propose a framework that utilizes multimodal GPT-4V to enhance embodied task planning through the combination of natural language instructions and robot visual perceptions [7]. Our results, based on diverse datasets, indicate that GPT-4V effectively enhances robot performance in embodied tasks [7]. This extensive survey and evaluation of LLMs and multimodal LLMs across a variety of robotic tasks enriches the understanding of LLM-centric embodied intelligence and provides forward-looking insights toward bridging the gap in Human-Robot-Environment interaction [7].\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities across domains, tasks, and languages [8]. Such human-level agents require semantic comprehension and instruction-following capabilities, which exactly fall into the strengths of LLMs [8]. Although there have been several initial attempts to build human-level agents based on LLMs, the theoretical foundation remains a challenging open problem [8]. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical cognitive architecture, the Unified Mind Model (UMM), which offers guidance to facilitate the rapid creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities [8]. Specifically, our UMM starts with the global workspace theory and further leverage LLMs to enable the agent with various cognitive abilities, such as multi-modal perception, planning, reasoning, tool use, learning, memory, reflection and motivation [8]. Building upon UMM, we then develop an agent-building engine, MindOS, which allows users to quickly create domain-/task-specific autonomous agents without any programming effort [8].\n\nIntellAgent is a scalable, open-source multi-agent framework designed to evaluate conversational AI systems comprehensively [9]. IntellAgent automates the creation of diverse, synthetic benchmarks by combining policy-driven graph modeling, realistic event generation, and interactive user-agent simulations [9]. This innovative approach provides fine-grained diagnostics, addressing the limitations of static and manually curated benchmarks with coarse-grained metrics [9]. IntellAgent represents a paradigm shift in evaluating conversational AI [9]. By simulating realistic, multi-policy scenarios across varying levels of complexity, IntellAgent captures the nuanced interplay of agent capabilities and policy constraints [9]. Unlike traditional methods, it employs a graph-based policy model to represent relationships, likelihoods, and complexities of policy interactions, enabling highly detailed diagnostics [9]. IntellAgent also identifies critical performance gaps, offering actionable insights for targeted optimization [9]. Its modular, open-source design supports seamless integration of new domains, policies, and APIs, fostering reproducibility and community collaboration [9]. Our findings demonstrate that IntellAgent serves as an effective framework for advancing conversational AI by addressing challenges in bridging research and deployment [9].\n\nAI Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs) as its cognitive core, is an intelligent agentic system capable of autonomously controlling and determining the execution paths under user's instructions [10]. With the burst of capabilities of LLMs and various plugins, such as RAG, text-to-image/video/3D, etc., the potential of AI Agents has been vastly expanded, with their capabilities growing stronger by the day [10]. However, at the intersection between AI and web3, there is currently no ideal agentic framework that can seamlessly integrate web3 applications into AI agent functionalities [10]. In this paper, we propose Eliza, the first open-source web3-friendly Agentic framework that makes the deployment of web3 applications effortless [10]. We emphasize that every aspect of Eliza is a regular Typescript program under the full control of its user, and it seamlessly integrates with web3 (i.e., reading and writing blockchain data, interacting with smart contracts, etc.) [10]. Furthermore, we show how stable performance is achieved through the pragmatic implementation of the key components of Eliza's runtime [10]. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ai16z/eliza [10].\n\nAI agents are defined as artificial entities to perceive the environment, make decisions and take actions [11]. Inspired by the 6 levels of autonomous driving by Society of Automotive Engineers, the AI agents are also categorized based on utilities and strongness, as the following levels: L0, no AI, with tools taking into account perception plus actions; L1, using rule-based AI; L2, making rule-based AI replaced by IL/RL-based AI, with additional reasoning & decision making; L3, applying LLM-based AI instead of IL/RL-based AI, additionally setting up memory & reflection; L4, based on L3, facilitating autonomous learning & generalization; L5, based on L4, appending personality of emotion and character and collaborative behavior with multi-agents [11].\n\n\n\nAnother significant aspect of AI agent frameworks is their ability to learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments . This requires new interaction protocols, delegation strategies, and responsibility distribution frameworks. For example, the AI Agents: Evolution, Architecture, and Real-World Applications paper  examines the evolution, architecture, and practical applications of AI agents, emphasizing both theoretical foundations and real-world deployments.\n\nFurthermore, AI agent frameworks can be categorized based on their utilities and strength, as follows: L0, no AI, with tools taking into account perception plus actions [0]; L1, using rule-based AI [0]; L2, making rule-based AI replaced by IL/RL-based AI, with additional reasoning & decision making [0]; L3, applying LLM-based AI instead of IL/RL-based AI, additionally setting up memory & reflection [0]; L4, based on L3, facilitating autonomous learning & generalization [0]; L5, based on L4, appending personality of emotion and character and collaborative behavior with multi-agents [0]. \n\nRecent advancements in AI agent implementations have focused on their ability to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. This includes the development of frameworks such as AutoAgent [1], a fully-automated and zero-code framework for LLM agents, and IntellAgent [9], a multi-agent framework for evaluating conversational AI systems. Additionally, Eliza [10] is a web3-friendly agentic framework that seamlessly integrates web3 applications into AI agent functionalities.\n\nIn summary, AI agent frameworks have evolved to integrate LLMs, learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments. They can be categorized based on their utilities and strength, and are being developed to tackle complex tasks such as AI research, human-AI teaming, and decision-making . Recent advancements in AI agent implementations have focused on their ability to achieve complex goals, and new frameworks have been developed to support these capabilities.\n\nRecent studies have also explored the integration of LLMs with multimodal perception, planning, and tool use, enabling AI agents to tackle complex tasks in various domains [7]. For example, the CATP-LLM framework [0] empowers LLMs for cost-aware tool planning, while the Unified Mind Model (UMM) [8] provides a novel theoretical cognitive architecture for creating autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities.

                    "section_text": "AI agent frameworks have evolved significantly over the years, with various architectures and capabilities being developed to tackle complex tasks [4]. The primary objectives of these frameworks are to enable AI agents to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. One of the key aspects of AI agent frameworks is their ability to integrate large language models (LLMs) with dedicated modules for perception, planning, and tool use [4]. For instance, the MLGym framework and benchmark [3] evaluate and develop LLM agents on AI research tasks, such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, and analyzing results. The framework consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory [3].\n\nThe MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks [3]. We find that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements [3].\n\nThis survey paper examines the recent advancements in AI agent implementations, with a focus on their ability to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. The primary objectives of this work are to a) communicate the current capabilities and limitations of existing AI agent implementations, b) share insights gained from our observations of these systems in action, and c) suggest important considerations for future developments in AI agent design [4]. We achieve this by providing overviews of single-agent and multi-agent architectures, identifying key patterns and divergences in design choices, and evaluating their overall impact on accomplishing a provided goal [4].\n\nThis paper examines the evolution, architecture, and practical applications of AI agents from their early, rule-based incarnations to modern sophisticated systems that integrate large language models with dedicated modules for perception, planning, and tool use [6]. Emphasizing both theoretical foundations and real-world deployments, the paper reviews key agent paradigms, discusses limitations of current evaluation benchmarks, and proposes a holistic evaluation framework that balances task effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and safety [6]. Applications across enterprise, personal assistance, and specialized domains are analyzed, with insights into future research directions for more resilient and adaptive AI agent systems [6].\n\nLifelong learning, also known as continual or incremental learning, is a crucial component for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by enabling systems to continuously adapt in dynamic environments [5]. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing, existing LLM agents are typically designed for static systems and lack the ability to adapt over time in response to new challenges [5]. This survey is the first to systematically summarize the potential techniques for incorporating lifelong learning into LLM-based agents [5]. We categorize the core components of these agents into three modules: the perception module for multimodal input integration, the memory module for storing and retrieving evolving knowledge, and the action module for grounded interactions with the dynamic environment [5]. We highlight how these pillars collectively enable continuous adaptation, mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and improve long-term performance [5].\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have undergone significant expansion and have been increasingly integrated across various domains [7]. Notably, in the realm of robot task planning, LLMs harness their advanced reasoning and language comprehension capabilities to formulate precise and efficient action plans based on natural language instructions [7]. However, for embodied tasks, where robots interact with complex environments, text-only LLMs often face challenges due to a lack of compatibility with robotic visual perception [7]. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging integration of LLMs and multimodal LLMs into various robotic tasks [7]. Additionally, we propose a framework that utilizes multimodal GPT-4V to enhance embodied task planning through the combination of natural language instructions and robot visual perceptions [7]. Our results, based on diverse datasets, indicate that GPT-4V effectively enhances robot performance in embodied tasks [7]. This extensive survey and evaluation of LLMs and multimodal LLMs across a variety of robotic tasks enriches the understanding of LLM-centric embodied intelligence and provides forward-looking insights toward bridging the gap in Human-Robot-Environment interaction [7].\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities across domains, tasks, and languages [8]. Such human-level agents require semantic comprehension and instruction-following capabilities, which exactly fall into the strengths of LLMs [8]. Although there have been several initial attempts to build human-level agents based on LLMs, the theoretical foundation remains a challenging open problem [8]. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical cognitive architecture, the Unified Mind Model (UMM), which offers guidance to facilitate the rapid creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities [8]. Specifically, our UMM starts with the global workspace theory and further leverage LLMs to enable the agent with various cognitive abilities, such as multi-modal perception, planning, reasoning, tool use, learning, memory, reflection and motivation [8]. Building upon UMM, we then develop an agent-building engine, MindOS, which allows users to quickly create domain-/task-specific autonomous agents without any programming effort [8].\n\nIntellAgent is a scalable, open-source multi-agent framework designed to evaluate conversational AI systems comprehensively [9]. IntellAgent automates the creation of diverse, synthetic benchmarks by combining policy-driven graph modeling, realistic event generation, and interactive user-agent simulations [9]. This innovative approach provides fine-grained diagnostics, addressing the limitations of static and manually curated benchmarks with coarse-grained metrics [9]. IntellAgent represents a paradigm shift in evaluating conversational AI [9]. By simulating realistic, multi-policy scenarios across varying levels of complexity, IntellAgent captures the nuanced interplay of agent capabilities and policy constraints [9]. Unlike traditional methods, it employs a graph-based policy model to represent relationships, likelihoods, and complexities of policy interactions, enabling highly detailed diagnostics [9]. IntellAgent also identifies critical performance gaps, offering actionable insights for targeted optimization [9]. Its modular, open-source design supports seamless integration of new domains, policies, and APIs, fostering reproducibility and community collaboration [9]. Our findings demonstrate that IntellAgent serves as an effective framework for advancing conversational AI by addressing challenges in bridging research and deployment [9].\n\nAI Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs) as its cognitive core, is an intelligent agentic system capable of autonomously controlling and determining the execution paths under user's instructions [10]. With the burst of capabilities of LLMs and various plugins, such as RAG, text-to-image/video/3D, etc., the potential of AI Agents has been vastly expanded, with their capabilities growing stronger by the day [10]. However, at the intersection between AI and web3, there is currently no ideal agentic framework that can seamlessly integrate web3 applications into AI agent functionalities [10]. In this paper, we propose Eliza, the first open-source web3-friendly Agentic framework that makes the deployment of web3 applications effortless [10]. We emphasize that every aspect of Eliza is a regular Typescript program under the full control of its user, and it seamlessly integrates with web3 (i.e., reading and writing blockchain data, interacting with smart contracts, etc.) [10]. Furthermore, we show how stable performance is achieved through the pragmatic implementation of the key components of Eliza's runtime [10]. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ai16z/eliza [10].\n\nAI agents are defined as artificial entities to perceive the environment, make decisions and take actions [11]. Inspired by the 6 levels of autonomous driving by Society of Automotive Engineers, the AI agents are also categorized based on utilities and strongness, as the following levels: L0, no AI, with tools taking into account perception plus actions; L1, using rule-based AI; L2, making rule-based AI replaced by IL/RL-based AI, with additional reasoning & decision making; L3, applying LLM-based AI instead of IL/RL-based AI, additionally setting up memory & reflection; L4, based on L3, facilitating autonomous learning & generalization; L5, based on L4, appending personality of emotion and character and collaborative behavior with multi-agents [11].\n\n\n\nAnother significant aspect of AI agent frameworks is their ability to learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments . This requires new interaction protocols, delegation strategies, and responsibility distribution frameworks. For example, the AI Agents: Evolution, Architecture, and Real-World Applications paper  examines the evolution, architecture, and practical applications of AI agents, emphasizing both theoretical foundations and real-world deployments.\n\nFurthermore, AI agent frameworks can be categorized based on their utilities and strength, as follows: L0, no AI, with tools taking into account perception plus actions [0]; L1, using rule-based AI [0]; L2, making rule-based AI replaced by IL/RL-based AI, with additional reasoning & decision making [0]; L3, applying LLM-based AI instead of IL/RL-based AI, additionally setting up memory & reflection [0]; L4, based on L3, facilitating autonomous learning & generalization [0]; L5, based on L4, appending personality of emotion and character and collaborative behavior with multi-agents [0]. \n\nRecent advancements in AI agent implementations have focused on their ability to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities [4]. This includes the development of frameworks such as AutoAgent [1], a fully-automated and zero-code framework for LLM agents, and IntellAgent [9], a multi-agent framework for evaluating conversational AI systems. Additionally, Eliza [10] is a web3-friendly agentic framework that seamlessly integrates web3 applications into AI agent functionalities.\n\nIn summary, AI agent frameworks have evolved to integrate LLMs, learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments. They can be categorized based on their utilities and strength, and are being developed to tackle complex tasks such as AI research, human-AI teaming, and decision-making . Recent advancements in AI agent implementations have focused on their ability to achieve complex goals, and new frameworks have been developed to support these capabilities.\n\nRecent studies have also explored the integration of LLMs with multimodal perception, planning, and tool use, enabling AI agents to tackle complex tasks in various domains [7]. For example, the CATP-LLM framework [0] empowers LLMs for cost-aware tool planning, while the Unified Mind Model (UMM) [8] provides a novel theoretical cognitive architecture for creating autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities. These frameworks and architectures demonstrate the potential of LLMs in multimodal tasks and highlight the need for further research in this area.\n\nMoreover, researchers have proposed frameworks for lifelong learning of LLM-based agents, enabling them to continuously adapt in dynamic environments [5]. These frameworks incorporate techniques such as multimodal perception, planning, and tool use, as well as memory and reflection modules, to enable continuous adaptation and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. For example, CATP-LLM [0] empowers LLMs for cost-aware tool planning, while AutoAgent [1] enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Additionally, frameworks such as Meta MLGym [3] and MLGym-Bench [3] provide a new framework and benchmark for evaluating and developing LLM agents on AI research tasks. Furthermore, the Unified Mind Model [8] offers guidance to facilitate the rapid creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities. \n\nIn conclusion, AI agent frameworks have evolved to integrate LLMs, learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments. They can be categorized based on their utilities and strength, and are being developed to tackle complex tasks such as AI research, human-AI teaming, and decision-making . Recent advancements in AI agent implementations have focused on their ability to achieve complex goals, and new frameworks have been developed to support these capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, AI agent frameworks have been applied in various real-world applications, including enterprise, personal assistance, and specialized domains [4]. For instance, AI agents have been used in customer service, healthcare, and finance to provide personalized assistance and decision-making support [1]. Additionally, AI agents have been used in robotics to enhance task planning and execution [7]. Moreover, AI agents have been used in web3 applications to provide seamless integration with AI functionalities [10]. Overall, AI agents have shown great potential in various domains and continue to be an active area of research [6]. \n\nOverall, AI agent frameworks have made significant progress in recent years, with various architectures and capabilities being developed to tackle complex tasks [4].

Its significance lies in its ability to simplify the creation and management of agents and their workflows, enabling efficient state management, dynamic workflow construction, and robust memory checkpointing [2]. The importance of language-based graph processing in LangGraph cannot be overstated, as it allows agents to dynamically determine control flows, invoke tools, and assess the necessity of further actions, improving flexibility and efficiency [2]. Moreover, LangGraph's graph-structured workflows enable agents to execute complex tasks, adapt to new inputs, and provide real-time feedback, ensuring seamless decision-making and execution in distributed environments [2]. However, it's worth noting that LangGraph may have limitations, such as potential drawbacks or limitations in certain applications [0]. For instance, a study on the application of Spark Streaming real-time data analysis system and large language model intelligent agents demonstrates the potential of LangGraph to enhance multilingual translation accuracy and scalability [3]. Another study on intelligent Spark agents highlights the framework's ability to simplify machine learning processes by allowing users to visually design workflows, which are then converted into Spark-compatible code for high-performance execution [2]. Additionally, LangGraph has been successfully applied in various AI agent frameworks, such as Agent AI with LangGraph, which has been shown to enhance machine translation using large language models [4]. The framework enables agents to perform specific tasks, such as translating between particular languages, while maintaining modularity, scalability, and context retention [4]. Furthermore, LangGraph has been used in intelligent Spark agents to enhance machine learning workflows through scalability, visualization, and intelligent process optimization [2]. The framework automates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, while dynamically interacting with data through Spark SQL and DataFrame agents [2]. LangGraph has also been explored in the context of multi-agent systems, where it improves the efficiency of information transmission through graph architecture [0]. Moreover, LangGraph has been used to develop an advanced RAG system based on graph technology, which efficiently searches and utilizes information to generate more accurate and enhanced responses [1]. In summary, LangGraph is a crucial component of AI agent frameworks, enabling efficient state management, dynamic workflow construction, and robust memory checkpointing [2]. Its language-based graph processing capabilities make it an essential tool for enhancing machine translation, real-time data analysis, and decision-making [2].

Its significance lies in its ability to simplify the creation and management of agents and their workflows, enabling efficient state management, dynamic workflow construction, and robust memory checkpointing [2]. The importance of language-based graph processing in LangGraph cannot be overstated, as it allows agents to dynamically determine control flows, invoke tools, and assess the necessity of further actions, improving flexibility and efficiency [2]. Moreover, LangGraph's graph-structured workflows enable agents to execute complex tasks, adapt to new inputs, and provide real-time feedback, ensuring seamless decision-making and execution in distributed environments [2]. However, it's worth noting that LangGraph may have limitations, such as potential drawbacks or limitations in certain applications [0]. For instance, a study on the application of Spark Streaming real-time data analysis system and large language model intelligent agents demonstrates the potential of LangGraph to enhance multilingual translation accuracy and scalability [3]. Another study on intelligent Spark agents highlights the framework's ability to simplify machine learning processes by allowing users to visually design workflows, which are then converted into Spark-compatible code for high-performance execution [2]. Additionally, LangGraph has been successfully applied in various AI agent frameworks, such as Agent AI with LangGraph, which has been shown to enhance machine translation using large language models [4]. The framework enables agents to perform specific tasks, such as translating between particular languages, while maintaining modularity, scalability, and context retention [4]. Furthermore, LangGraph has been used in intelligent Spark agents to enhance machine learning workflows through scalability, visualization, and intelligent process optimization [2]. The framework automates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, while dynamically interacting with data through Spark SQL and DataFrame agents [2]. LangGraph has also been explored in the context of multi-agent systems, where it improves the efficiency of information transmission through graph architecture [0]. Moreover, LangGraph has been used to develop an advanced RAG system based on graph technology, which efficiently searches and utilizes information to generate more accurate and enhanced responses [1]. In summary, LangGraph is a crucial component of AI agent frameworks, enabling efficient state management, dynamic workflow construction, and robust memory checkpointing [2]. Its language-based graph processing capabilities make it an essential tool for enhancing machine translation, real-time data analysis, and decision-making [2].

                                "section_text": "LangGraph is a graph-based framework that plays a crucial role in AI agent frameworks, particularly in enhancing machine translation, real-time data analysis, and decision-making [2]. Its significance lies in its ability to simplify the creation and management of agents and their workflows, enabling efficient state management, dynamic workflow construction, and robust memory checkpointing [2]. The importance of language-based graph processing in LangGraph cannot be overstated, as it allows agents to dynamically determine control flows, invoke tools, and assess the necessity of further actions, improving flexibility and efficiency [2]. Moreover, LangGraph's graph-structured workflows enable agents to execute complex tasks, adapt to new inputs, and provide real-time feedback, ensuring seamless decision-making and execution in distributed environments [2]. However, it's worth noting that LangGraph may have limitations, such as potential drawbacks or limitations in certain applications [0]. For instance, a study on the application of Spark Streaming real-time data analysis system and large language model intelligent agents demonstrates the potential of LangGraph to enhance multilingual translation accuracy and scalability [3]. Another study on intelligent Spark agents highlights the framework's ability to simplify machine learning processes by allowing users to visually design workflows, which are then converted into Spark-compatible code for high-performance execution [2]. Additionally, LangGraph has been successfully applied in various AI agent frameworks, such as Agent AI with LangGraph, which has been shown to enhance machine translation using large language models [4]. The framework enables agents to perform specific tasks, such as translating between particular languages, while maintaining modularity, scalability, and context retention [4]. Furthermore, LangGraph has been used in intelligent Spark agents to enhance machine learning workflows through scalability, visualization, and intelligent process optimization [2]. The framework automates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, while dynamically interacting with data through Spark SQL and DataFrame agents [2]. LangGraph has also been explored in the context of multi-agent systems, where it improves the efficiency of information transmission through graph architecture [0]. Moreover, LangGraph has been used to develop an advanced RAG system based on graph technology, which efficiently searches and utilizes information to generate more accurate and enhanced responses [1]. In summary, LangGraph is a crucial component of AI agent frameworks, enabling efficient state management, dynamic workflow construction, and robust memory checkpointing [2]. Its language-based graph processing capabilities make it an essential tool for enhancing machine translation, real-time data analysis, and decision-making [2]. While it may have limitations, the supporting scholarly articles demonstrate the potential of LangGraph to improve various AI applications, making it a valuable resource for practical application [0][1][2][3][4].",
                                "section_summary": "LangGraph is a modular AI agent framework that allows developers to build, train, and manage autonomous agents for tasks such as machine translation, utilizing large language models (LLMs). Its graph-based architecture enables efficient tool and workflow creation, integration with systems like Spark for handling large-scale data streams, and it also supports dynamic state management. LangGraph has proven its versatility in various fields such as dialogue systems and secure task delegation, demonstrating its potential in building AI agents capable of interacting with their environment and making informed decisions.",

            "section_text": "The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, enabling autonomous systems to plan, reason, use tools, and maintain memory while interacting with dynamic environments . However, evaluating these agents remains a significant challenge, as traditional methods fail to capture the complexity and variability of real-world interactions . To address this challenge, several AI agent frameworks have been proposed.\n\nOne such framework is IntellAgent , a scalable, open-source multi-agent framework designed to evaluate conversational AI systems comprehensively. IntellAgent automates the creation of diverse, synthetic benchmarks by combining policy-driven graph modeling, realistic event generation, and interactive user-agent simulations . This innovative approach provides fine-grained diagnostics, addressing the limitations of static and manually curated benchmarks with coarse-grained metrics .\n\nAnother framework is AutoAgent , a fully-automated and zero-code framework for LLM agents that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through natural language alone [4]. AutoAgent comprises four key components: agentic system utilities, LLM-powered actionable engine, self-managing file system, and self-play agent customization module [4]. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention [4]. AutoAgent also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants and has shown consistently superior performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions [4].\n\nIn addition, Eliza is a web3-friendly AI agent operating system that makes the deployment of web3 applications effortless and seamlessly integrates with web3 [1]. Eliza emphasizes that every aspect of it is a regular Typescript program under the full control of its user and provides stable performance through the pragmatic implementation of its key components [1].\n\nFurthermore, the design and evaluation of multi-agent collaboration frameworks, such as the one presented in [3], have emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex, multi-faceted problems that exceed the capabilities of single AI agents [3]. This report addresses the challenges of designing the collaboration protocols and evaluating the effectiveness of these systems by presenting a comprehensive evaluation of coordination and routing capabilities in a novel multi-agent collaboration framework [3]. The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of inter-agent communication and payload referencing mechanisms, achieving end-to-end goal success rates of 90% [3]. \n\nIn summary, several AI agent frameworks have been proposed to address the challenges of evaluating and developing LLM agents, including IntellAgent [2], AutoAgent [4], and Eliza [1]. These frameworks provide innovative approaches to evaluating conversational AI systems, enabling users to create and deploy LLM agents through natural language alone, and making the deployment of web3 applications effortless [1]. Furthermore, the design and evaluation of multi-agent collaboration frameworks have emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex, multi-faceted problems that exceed the capabilities of single AI agents [3].\n\nThe comparison of these frameworks highlights the importance of considering the specific needs and requirements of each application domain when selecting an AI agent framework [0]. For instance, IntellAgent is well-suited for evaluating conversational AI systems [2], while AutoAgent is ideal for creating and deploying LLM agents through natural language alone [4]. Eliza, on the other hand, is designed for web3 applications [1]. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each framework, developers can make informed decisions and choose the most appropriate tool for their specific use case [0]. \n\nThe emergence of AI agent frameworks has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, enabling autonomous systems to plan, reason, use tools, and maintain memory while interacting with dynamic environments [0].

            "section_text": "AI agent frameworks play a crucial role in artificial intelligence systems, providing a structured approach to designing and developing intelligent agents that can interact with and adapt to complex environments . These frameworks offer a set of principles, components, and guidelines that help to create agents that can learn, reason, and act autonomously, with the ability to collaborate with humans and other agents.\n\nA well-defined AI agent framework can help to address several challenges in AI systems, including the complexity of developing autonomous agents, the need for efficient and effective decision-making, and the requirement for agents to adapt to changing environments [2]. By providing a clear structure and set of principles, AI agent frameworks can help to ensure that agents are designed and developed in a consistent and scalable manner, which is essential for achieving reliable and robust AI systems [2]. Furthermore, AI agent frameworks can help to address the limitations of current evaluation benchmarks and provide a holistic evaluation framework that balances task effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and safety [0]. Additionally, AI agent frameworks can facilitate the development of multi-Agent systems, which can better facilitate human learners' learning and enhance their teaching abilities [1]. Overall, AI agent frameworks are crucial for ensuring that AI systems are designed and developed in a responsible and ethical manner [3]. \n\nOne example of an AI agent framework is the von Neumann multi-Agent system framework, which breaks down each AI agent into four modules: control unit, logic unit, storage unit, and input-output devices . This framework also defines four types of operations: task deconstruction, self-reflection, memory processing, and tool invocation. Additionally, it introduces related technologies such as Chain-of-Thought, Reson+Act, and Multi-Agent Debate associated with these four types of operations. The framework also discusses the ability enhancement cycle of a multi-Agent system for education, including the outer circulation for human learners to promote knowledge construction and the inner circulation for LLM-based-Agents to enhance swarm intelligence.\n\nAnother example is the code-based assessment of autonomy framework, which assesses the level of agent autonomy by scoring the orchestration code used to run an AI agent according to a taxonomy that evaluates attributes of autonomy, such as impact and oversight [5]. This framework eliminates the need to run an AI agent to perform specific tasks, reducing the costs and risks associated with run-time evaluations.\n\nMoreover, the AI Agent Index is a public database that documents information about currently deployed agentic AI systems, including their components, application domains, and risk management practices [8]. This resource can help to fill the gap in documenting the technical components and intended uses of agentic systems [8].\n\nEliza is another example of an agentic framework that makes the deployment of web3 applications effortless, seamlessly integrating web3 applications into AI agent functionalities [4]. Eliza is an open-source web3-friendly Agentic framework that makes the deployment of web3 applications effortless.\n\nFurthermore, the AutoGen framework is a code-based assessment of autonomy that eliminates the need to run an AI agent to perform specific tasks, reducing the costs and risks associated with run-time evaluations [5]. This framework assesses the level of agent autonomy by scoring the orchestration code used to run an AI agent according to a taxonomy that evaluates attributes of autonomy, such as impact and oversight [5]. \n\nIn addition to these frameworks, there are also other AI agent architectures, such as decentralized governance models like ETHOS [6], which propose a decentralized governance model leveraging Web3 technologies to address the complexities of autonomous AI agents. ETHOS establishes a global registry for AI agents, enabling dynamic risk classification, proportional oversight, and automated compliance monitoring through tools like soulbound tokens and zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nThe landscape of emerging AI agent architectures for reasoning, planning, and tool calling is also an area of interest, with recent advancements in AI agent implementations, such as the survey paper on AI agent implementations , which explores the current capabilities and limitations of existing AI agent implementations and shares insights gained from observations of these systems in action [2].\n\n\nMoreover, the perceptions of agentic AI in organizations are also an important aspect, with studies highlighting the challenges in organizational adaptation, characterized by knowledge gaps, a limited emphasis on stakeholder engagement, and a strong focus on control [3]. These factors, by hindering effective adaptation and implementation, ultimately compromise the potential for responsible AI and the realization of ROI.\n\nIn summary, AI agent frameworks provide a crucial foundation for designing and developing intelligent agents that can interact with and adapt to complex environments, and play a key role in achieving reliable and robust AI systems . By providing a clear structure and set of principles, AI agent frameworks can help to ensure that agents are designed and developed in a consistent and scalable manner, and can address several challenges in AI systems, including complexity, efficiency, and adaptability .\n\nAI agent frameworks are essential for designing and developing intelligent agents that can interact with and adapt to complex environments . They provide a structured approach to designing and developing agents that can learn, reason, and act autonomously, with the ability to collaborate with humans and other agents. AI agent frameworks can help to address several challenges in AI systems, including complexity, efficiency, and adaptability .\n\nIn conclusion, AI agent frameworks play a crucial role in artificial intelligence systems, providing a structured approach to designing and developing intelligent agents that can interact with and adapt to complex environments [2]. By providing a clear structure and set of principles, AI agent frameworks can help to ensure that agents are designed and developed in a consistent and scalable manner, and can address several challenges in AI systems, including complexity, efficiency, and adaptability [0]. AI agent frameworks can also enable the development of agentic AI systems that can plan and execute complex tasks with limited human involvement, and provide a structured framework for documenting the technical components, intended uses, and safety features of agentic systems [8]. Additionally, AI agent frameworks can be used to measure AI agent autonomy, providing a scalable approach with code inspection [5]. Overall, AI agent frameworks are essential for the development of autonomous AI agents that can interact with and adapt to complex environments, and can provide a structured approach to designing and developing intelligent agents [2].
